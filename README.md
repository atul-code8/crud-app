## MERN Stack CRUD Application (Notes)

This is a full-stack CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application built using the MERN stack:

- MongoDB: NoSQL database to store data.
- Express: Web framework for Node.js to handle API routing.
- React: Front-end JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- Node.js: JavaScript runtime for the server-side logic.

This application allows users to manage a list of items (for example, tasks or notes) through a simple interface. It demonstrates basic CRUD functionality, such as creating, reading, updating, and deleting records.


### Features

- Create: Add new items to the list.
- Read: View a list of all items in the database.
- Update: Edit existing items.
- Delete: Remove items from the list.

### Technologies Used

- Frontend: React, Axios (for API requests), CSS
- Backend: Node.js, Express, MongoDB, Mongoose
- Database: MongoDB (local or cloud-based, e.g., MongoDB Atlas)
- Development Tools: Node, npm, nodemon, create-react-app, Postman (for API testing)
